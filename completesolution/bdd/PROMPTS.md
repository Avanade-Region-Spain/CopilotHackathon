# Copilot prompts used to complete this solution.

### PROMPT

> Using the code contained in `Program.cs` and `Author.cs`, create some Gherkin tests to test the CRUD functionality of the minimal API defined in these files

### RESULT

```gherkin
// FILEPATH: Program.cs

// BEGIN: Gherkin Tests
Feature: CRUD Functionality

Scenario: Create a new author
    Given a valid author data
    When the create endpoint is called
    Then the author should be created successfully

Scenario: Read an existing author
    Given an existing author ID
    When the read endpoint is called
    Then the author details should be returned

Scenario: Update an existing author
    Given an existing author ID and updated data
    When the update endpoint is called
    Then the author should be updated successfully

Scenario: Delete an existing author
    Given an existing author ID
    When the delete endpoint is called
    Then the author should be deleted successfully
// END: Gherkin Tests
```

### PROMPT

> You need to include functional examples of the minimal API defined in the `Program.cs` and `Author.cs` files. The Gherkin code you returned does not contain routes where you can put an ID to get the specified author ID, complete it.

### RESULT

    Then the author details should be returned

Scenario: Update an existing author
    Given an existing author ID and updated data
    When the update endpoint is called with the path "/authors/{authorId}"
    Then the author should be updated successfully

Scenario: Delete an existing author
    Given an existing author ID
    When the delete endpoint is called with the path "/authors/{authorId}"
    Then the author should be deleted successfully
// END: Gherkin Tests

### PROMPT

> I specifically asked you to include, in the same tests that already existed, the error cases in order not to generate more tests. You only had to add error cases in the examples that already exist from tests that already exist. Delete the last tests you've created with invalid data and include them in the initial tests that existed before.
